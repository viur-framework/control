						<h1>Welcome to the ViUR Control Tour</h1>
						<p>We have garthered some documentation and tips and tricks for you to be able to efficiently
							use ViUR Control.</p>
						<p><strong>So let's start the Tour!</strong></p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="content" id="depencency-wizard">
					<div class="nice-section">
						<h1>Dependency Wizard</h1>
						<p>For you to be able to use all of ViUR Controls features you should have installed the following tools
							and software.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Python 2.7.x</li>
							<li>node.js</li>
							<li>git</li>
							<li>Google cloud SDK</li>
							<li>app-engine-python component for gcloud</li>
							<li>lessc</li>
							<li>pyjs</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Feel free to install these on your own or use our installation wizard. You can find the tool
                            in the Menu -> File -> Open Dependencies Wizard</p>

						<h1>Settings</h1>
						<p>For ViUR Control to work properly some configuration is necessary.</p>
						<p>To open the settings window, please go into global menu to File -> Settings or use the
							global shortcut shown in the Menu.</p>
						<p>The <strong>Projects Directory</strong> should point to the directory where all of your ViUR
							projects are stored.
							Usually you already have such a directory when you use an IDE like pyCharm, Atom etc.</p>
						<p>Optionally you can point the <strong>Gcloud Tool Path</strong> to the custom directory of
							google-cloud-sdk if you do not want to use the on in your PATH, or have a custom setup.</p>
						<p><strong>Initials as part of version string</strong> is just an aid to supplement automatic
							version strings for deploying your ViUR instance later on.</p>
						<p><strong>Background Color</strong> and <strong>Foreground Color</strong> selects the
							appropriate colors for terminals/ output windows when a task is running.
							Some developers are more used to white text on dark background - other prefer the opposite
							or even more colorful outputs ;)</p>
						<p>You will find all configuration data in your users' config directory <a href=""><strong
								class="js-user-config-dir"></strong></a></p>

						<h1>Projects</h1>
						<h2>Introduction</h2>

						<p>Projects are the basic resource we will work on. They are basically directories with one
							or
							more ViUR
							subdirectories
							inside.
						</p>
						<p>You will have direct access to them on the left sidebar of the main window.</p>
						<p>In the global settings you have to choose a directory, which will host all such project
							directories.</p>
						<p>The information a project defines includes the projects' directory name, its absolute
							path,
							port settings
							for local development, etc</p>
						<p>ViUR Control walks through your project directory and scans for valid ViUR projects,
							which
							basically
							means it looks for directories with an app.yaml file.</p>
						<p>The list of projects will be stored in your user data directory as a json file called
							"projects.json"</p>
						<p>You can refresh/rescan your projects list calling the action in the File Menu. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="nice-section" id="project-directory-name">
						<h2>directoryName</h2>
						<p>
							The <strong>directoryName</strong> is used as the displayed name in the project list
							on
							the left side of the main window
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="nice-section" id="project-absolute-path">
						<h2>absolutePath</h2>
						<p>
							The <strong>absolutePath</strong> is used by local dev server and deployment
							actions.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="nice-section" id="project-server-port">
						<h2>Local Server Port</h2>
						<p>
							The <strong>Local Server Port</strong> is the port this project is running on, on the
							local development server.
						</p>
						<p>After starting your project, you can click on the &raquo;Open&laquo; button to open it in
							your
							preferred browser. e.g http://localhost:10000.
						</p>
						<p>By default, the port numbers of <strong>Local Server Port</strong> and <strong>Local
							Admin Port</strong> have a numeric gap of 5 e.g 10000 -> 10005.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="nice-section" id="project-admin-port">
						<h2>Local Admin Port</h2>
						<p>
							The <strong>Local Admin Port</strong> is the port the management and inspection
							console
							is running on the local development server.
						</p>
						<p>After starting your project, you can click on the &raquo;Server Console&laquo; button to open
							it in your
							preferred browser. e.g http://localhost:10000.
						</p>
						<p>By default, the port numbers of <strong>Local Server Port</strong> and <strong>Local
							Admin Port</strong> have a numeric gap of 5 e.g 10000 -> 10005.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="nice-section" id="project-application-ids">
						<h2>Assigned Application-Ids</h2>
						<p>The <strong>Assigned Application-Ids</strong> table holds all unique project
							identifiers
							used by google. They are globally unique and are used for running local
							development
							instances and also as
							deployment targets to appengine.
						</p>
						<p>When creating new projects you will get a default application id.</p>

						<p>ViUR Control also fetches all applicationIds you are allowed to manage via the
							following
							command in a background task:
						<pre><code>gcloud --format json projects list</code></pre>
						and provides a dropdown menu element to add further ones to your
						project.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="nice-section" id="project-subdirectories">
						<h2>Usable subdirectories</h2>
						<p>
							The entries in the <strong>Usable subdirectories</strong> table represent relative
							paths to
							(sub-)directories inside your project where an app.yaml resides.
						</p>
						<p>
							We consider it best practice, if your project directory has a deploy or appengine
							subdirectory inside, with your deployable ViUR instance. Regardless it's also ok to have the
							project
							directory itself contain the deployable code with an app.yaml file.
						</p>
						<p>
							In practice this means you should have a subdirectory named deploy where your production code lives.
						</p>
						<p>
							But you also could have a directory called 'download' for example, where you fetched an
							already
							deployed version with the appcfg.py
							tool to inspect the code which is already running on a google appengine instance.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="nice-section" id="project-credentials">
						<h2>Credentials</h2>
						<p>
							The <strong>Credentials</strong> table holds combinations of usernames and passwords
							by
							applicationIds. This credentials are just used for local instances.
						</p>
						<p>
							This table will be automatically filled by ViUR Control by parsing the output on
							first
							run for each new applicationId for this project.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="nice-section" id="project-versions">
						<h2>Deployed Versions</h2>
						<p>
							This table will display all versions which are presently deployed on google appengine
							of
							the google project referenced with the activated applicationId.
						</p>
						<p>All versions by applicationId are globally cached in your config directory with a
							timestamp.</p>
						<p>The corresponding gcloud command to receive this list of versions would be:
						<pre><code>gcloud --format json --project ${applicationId} app versions list</code></pre>
						</p>
						<p>You can refresh this table as needed</p>
					</div>
					<div class="nice-section" id="project-indexes">
						<h2>Indexes</h2>
						<p>
							Google appengine uses resources called indexes for queries on indexed properties in kinds.
							The description of these indexes is
							generated when you use your development instance and is stored in a file called
							index.yaml.
						</p>
						<p>ViUR Control will check if you already have commited and pushed this file via git. That does
							not mean the indexes are already up to date on your appengine project.</p>

						<p>The corresponding gcloud command to deploy this index schema would be:
						<pre><code>gcloud --project ${applicationId} app deploy index.yaml</code></pre>
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="nice-section" id="labels">
						<h2>Project Labels</h2>
						<p>
							In the console on insert link here, you can tag your projects with custom key,value pairs.
						</p>
						<p>We tag our projects with 'customer: name' or 'status: testing|production' for example</p>

						<p>In the label settings you can select your preffered icons by label. Don't forget to save your stuff!
						</p>
